# Udacity-Project-1-PopularMovies1

This is the third project of nine in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program. 

These are the mandates for the project: 

You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.


I run a Http request for the trailer and the reviews in the background and bind them to the appropriate widget. I used SQLite database to save the favourite movies and use the menu option toggle to display the list of favourite movies.
